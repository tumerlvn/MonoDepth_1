A small wrapper for core parts of Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), c++ library for linear algebra. It is mainly useful for inspecting c++ code which already uses eigen and boost::python. Supported types are Vectors (2,3,6 and dynamic-sized with integer, floating-point and complex values), Matrices (3x3, 6x6 and dynamic-sized with floating-point and complex values), Quaternions and 2d and 3d aligned boxes. Numerous methods are wrapped and the original API of Eigen is followed. The code compiles with a c++99 compiler. The documentation is at http://eudoxos.github.io/minieigen .
